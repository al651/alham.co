Welcome to my website! It took a lot of effort and time to create as I wanted the website to not use a template so I had to make everything from scratch.

One of the most significant  reasons this website took so long is that I had never used React or JavaScript before, so I was going into this project essentially blind, teaching myself as I went.

The first place I went when starting was immediately to find websites that achieved what I was trying to achieve. I took note of their designs and had a look at some of the html code that the websites used.

It seems that despite how long the site took to make, that it actually did pay off overall because it allowed me to customise things to a level of detail that web design platforms like WordPress simply cannot. One perfect example of this is in the site's performance. Platforms such as WordPress offer plugins and functions created for the general website but if you want code that works best for your specific website, as well as understanding how it's all working for further iterations, then coding it myself was ultimately the best option.

I don't think this will be the end of my development on this website though. Knowing myself I will probably continue to iterate over time but for now I am happy with this.
