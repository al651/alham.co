# The Development of This Website

Welcome to my website! It took a lot of effort and time to create as I wanted the website to not use a template so I had to make everything from scratch.

One of the most significant reasons this website took so long is that I had never used React or JavaScript before, so I was going into this project essentially blind, teaching myself as I went.

The first place I went when starting was immediately to find websites that achieved what I was trying to achieve. I took note of their designs and had a look at some of the html code that the websites used.
