Welcome to my website! It took a lot of effort and time to create, as I wanted the website not to use a template, so I had to make everything from scratch.

One of the most significant reasons this website took so long is that I had never used React or JavaScript before, so I was going into this project essentially blind, teaching myself as I went. I ended up using HTMl, CSS and Javascript for this project with the React framework. I debated using more front-end platforms such as Gatsby and Tailwind but this being my first React project, I wanted to keep it simple.

The first place I went when starting was immediately to find websites that achieved what I was trying to achieve. I took note of their designs and had a look at some of the HTML code that the websites used. The idea was not to copy but to instead take inspiration and understand how things were done under the hood, it is what makes websites so intriguing for beginners. You can get a base understanding of every website by looking at the html code and how it's organised.

Despite how long the site took to make, it did pay off overall because it allowed me to customise things to a level of detail that web design platforms like WordPress simply cannot. One perfect example of this is in the site's performance. Platforms such as WordPress offer plugins and functions created for the general website. However, if you want code that works best for a specific website and to understand how it's all working for further iterations, then coding it myself was ultimately the best option.

It shouldn't be the end of my development on this website, though. Knowing myself, I will continue to iterate over time, but I am happy with this for now.
