Welcome to my website! It took a lot of effort and time to create, as I wanted the website not to use a template, so I had to make everything from scratch.

One of the most significant reasons this website took so long is that I had never used React or JavaScript before, so I was going into this project essentially blind, teaching myself as I went. I ended up using HTMl, CSS and Javascript for this project with the React framework. I debated using more front-end platforms such as Gatsby and Tailwind but this being my first React project, I wanted to keep it simple.

The first place I went when starting was immediately to find websites that achieved what I was trying to achieve. I took note of their designs and had a look at some of the HTML code that the websites used. The idea was not to copy but to instead take inspiration and understand how things were done under the hood, it is what makes websites so intriguing for beginners. You can get a base understanding of every website by looking at the html code and how it's organised.

Despite how long the site took to make, it did pay off overall because it allowed me to customise things to a level of detail that web design platforms like WordPress simply cannot. One perfect example of this is in the site's performance. Platforms such as WordPress offer plugins and functions created for the general website. However, if you want code that works best for a specific website and to understand how it's all working for further iterations, then coding it myself was ultimately the best option.

It shouldn't be the end of my development on this website, though. Knowing myself, I will continue to iterate over time, but I am happy with this for now.

## Update: 06/02/2024

Since this site went live, I've been mostly working on making it more performant for low tier hardware and constantly evolving the mobile phone and small screen experience.

One of the biggest changes that I made which improved performance by 50% in some cases is making youtube embeds use a [lite-youtube-embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed). This form of rendering for iframe elements is said to be 224x faster and I have definitely felt the improvements on those pages.

## Update: 21/05/2024

I published a fairly major update to the website today, which I have been sitting on for a while. I made a website footer and included a section on the about page for certifications because the page always felt a bit too empty to me.

Even though I wrote the code for these features a few months back, I decided to put it off until now. I wanted to finish some courses I was working on, but I realised it would take longer than expected, so I decided just to publish the update. It will make the site look better, too, and I can always add the certifications later on.
