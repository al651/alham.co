A few years ago I had an idea to create a remote firework firing system. Even before starting research for this project, I knew that I was likely not the first to come up with this idea. At first, I wasn't planning on making something different but just wanted to make something cool and learn from it. After a while, I thought of ways I could actually make something more unique.
