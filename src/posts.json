It took a lot of effort and time to create, as I wanted the website not to use a template, so I had to make everything from scratch.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant reasons this website took so long is that I had never used React or JavaScript before, so I was going into this project essentially blind, teaching myself as I went.\r\n\r\nThe first place I went when starting was immediately to find websites that achieved what I was trying to achieve. I took note of their designs and had a look at some of the HTML code that the websites used.\r\n\r\nDespite how long the site took to make, it did pay off overall because it allowed me to customise things to a level of detail that web design platforms like WordPress simply cannot. One perfect example of this is in the site's performance. Platforms such as WordPress offer plugins and functions created for the general website. However, if you want code that works best for a specific website and to understand how it's all working for further iterations, then coding it myself was ultimately the best option.\r\n\r\n<img className=\"post-img\" src=\"/images/site-performance.png\" alt=\"Site performance\">\r\n\r\n<div className=\"img-subtitle\">A high performance Lighthouse test report for the landing page.</div>\r\n\r\nI don't think this will be the end of my development on this website though. Knowing myself I will probably continue to iterate over time but for now I am happy with this.\r\n\r\n"}]
