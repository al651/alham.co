After iterating through several other ideas, I finalized this idea because it combined my love of programming with my love of electronics and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe idea came from Amazon's home security robot, [Astro](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Amazon-Astro/dp/B078NSDFSB). Although this robot is currently available under invite only as of writing this, it was revealed to sell for about $1500. I looked at this product and similar ones and thought I could make it cheaper while also scratching that mechanical and electronic engineering itch I had.\r\n\r\nThe idea was for a proof of concept, a fully autonomous robot that could detect objects in front of it and be accessed remotely through the internet.\r\n\r\nThe project was made in two main sections: the app and the robot.\r\n\r\n## The App\r\n\r\nThe app was made in Flutter, below is a demo of the app.\r\n\r\n<iframe id=\"QE4tuhMR4Xg\" title=\"Demonstration of a connection to the camera on the robot.\" poster=\"maxresdefault\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n    <figcaption>In the video I connect to the local IP address of the ESP32-CAM.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n## The Robot\r\n\r\nGiven more time, I could have made a nicer-looking and better-functioning robot, but since it was a proof of concept, I made this.\r\n\r\n<zoom>\r\n    <img className=\"post-img\" src=\"/media/2023-10-06-home-security-robot/my-messy-robot-design.avif\" alt=\"My home security robot.\">\r\n</zoom>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n    <figcaption>The final robot design.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\nThe robot was made using a simple car kit I found on Amazon, and I modified the design by drilling a bunch of holes in the plastic. In retrospect, there were better ways of mounting stuff to this chassis.\r\n\r\n<iframe id=\"AAkUKtALuzk\" title=\"Demonstration of the robot, showcasing its collision avoidance.\" poster=\"maxresdefault\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n    <figcaption>A video demo of the robot, showcasing its collision avoidance.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\nFor those interested in more of the technical aspects of this project, I made the source code available on [Github](https://github.com/al651/Home_Security_Robot) with further details in the [README](https://github.com/al651/Home_Security_Robot/blob/main/README.md) file.\r\n"},{"id":1695510000,"title":"The Development of This Website\r","slug":"2023-09-24-the-development-of-this-website","card_img":"/media/2023-09-24-the-development-of-this-website/website-icon.png\r","date":"September 24, 2023\r","content":"\r\nWelcome to my website! It took a lot of effort and time to create, as I wanted the website not to use a template, so I had to make everything from scratch.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant reasons this website took so long is that I had never used React or JavaScript before, so I was going into this project essentially blind, teaching myself as I went. I ended up using HTMl, CSS and Javascript for this project with the React framework. I debated using more front-end platforms such as Gatsby and Tailwind but this being my first React project, I wanted to keep it simple.\r\n\r\nThe first place I went when starting was immediately to find websites that achieved what I was trying to achieve. I took note of their designs and had a look at some of the HTML code that the websites used. The idea was not to copy but to instead take inspiration and understand how things were done under the hood, it is what makes websites so intriguing for beginners. You can get a base understanding of every website by looking at the html code and how it's organised.\r\n\r\nDespite how long the site took to make, it did pay off overall because it allowed me to customise things to a level of detail that web design platforms like WordPress simply cannot. One perfect example of this is in the site's performance. Platforms such as WordPress offer plugins and functions created for the general website. However, if you want code that works best for a specific website and to understand how it's all working for further iterations, then coding it myself was ultimately the best option.\r\n\r\n<zoom>\r\n    <img className=\"post-img\" src=\"/media/2023-09-24-the-development-of-this-website/site-performance.png\" alt=\"Site performance\">\r\n</zoom>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n    <figcaption>A high performance Lighthouse test report for the landing page.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be the end of my development on this website, though. Knowing myself, I will continue to iterate over time, but I am happy with this for now.\r\n\r\n## Update: 06/02/2024\r\n\r\nSince this site went live, I've been mostly working on making it more performant for low tier hardware and constantly evolving the mobile phone and small screen experience.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest changes that I made which improved performance by 50% in some cases is making youtube embeds use a [lite-youtube-embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed). This form of rendering for iframe elements is said to be 224x faster and I have definitely felt the improvements on those pages."}]
